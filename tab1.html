					<p id=paragraph>
						<p>I am currently a student at Champlain College, majoring in Computer Networking and Cybersecurity.</p>
						<p>Technology has been an interest of mine for years, ever since I built my first gaming PC in 2009 when I was turning 13. I have work experience in the IT industry, including three IT intern positions thus far at Travelers Insurance. As my major suggests, I have a strong interest in cybersecurity and am pursuing a career in it.</p>
						<p>I also own a YouTube channel focused on technology, with over 5,000 subscribers and about 200 videos so far. The primary focus of my videos was originally computer hardware, as I ran a small online business refurbishing and selling computer hardware, but my focus has since turned more towards service-based technologies alongside my now primary interest in computer networking and cybersecurity.</p>
